# Retrieving metadata from a EC2 bootstraped instance - Hands-on

[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

I'm currently preparing `AWS` Certified Solution Architect - Associate certificate.<br>
In the following gist you'll learn how to automate the deployment of an `EC2` instance on `AWS` and retrieve the instance metadata.
The hand-on will consist on a simple web server deployment using `Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud` and you'll learn how to access its metadata from the `AWSCLI`.<br>
I performed this setup on my `Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS`.<br>
To check your OS version, execute `$ lsb_release -a` in your Terminal.

## Installations
None. Just log into your AWS management console, https://console.aws.amazon.com.<br>
You'll need to perform several tasks in your `CLI` regarding `SSH` keygen, so make sure you check the following prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

First, make sure Oracle `jdk` is installed. I recommend `java 1.8.0`<br>
To uninstall effectively your current `jdk`, perform this:<br>
`$ sudo apt-get remove openjdk*`<br>
`$ sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove openjdk*`<br>
`$ sudo apt-get purge openjdk*`<br>
`$ sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove openjdk*`<br>

To install `java 1.8.0`, open Terminal `Ctrl+Alt+T` and run the command:<br>
`$  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java` // adds PPA repository<br>
`$  sudo apt-get update` // updates package list<br>
`$  sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk` // installs openjdk<br><br>

`$  javac -version` // shows your new java version
